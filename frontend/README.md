# Usage
## Add a New Package

### Method 1 (Directly append to `package.json`)

### Method 2 (Using `npm install` command)
On an assumption that you are bind-mounting this (`frontend`) directory using the ways described below, you can install a new package as follows.
- Copy the container ID of `frontend` image from `docker ps`.
- Run `docker exec -it {container ID} sh` to dive into the shell inside the container.
- Inside that shell, run `npm install {desired_package_name}` to install dependencies in the container.
  - This also updates the `package.json` file on the host through bind mounting.
  - Therefore, when you stop the container and run it again, you will probably want to rebuild the image beforehand.

## How to Run the App in a Development Environment

### Using Docker Compose
- On the parent directory (project root dir), run `docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up --build`
  - `--build` option is only necessary if you want to rebuild images using the Dockerfiles.
  - This command sets up a real-time test environment as well.

### Using Docker Commands
- Build the image first by running `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t <some_tag> .`
- Start a container using the built image `docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /home/node/app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/home/node/app -t <some_tag>`


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
